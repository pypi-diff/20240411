-## Get Started
-
-```sh
-pip install filetrack  # Install
-
-filetrack  # Run FileTrack according filetrack.toml in current folder.
-filetrack -h/--help  # Show help message.
-filetrack -v/--version  # Show version.
-filetrack -c/--config $config_file  # Run FileTrack according to the config file.
-```
-
-## Installation
-
-```sh
-# pip
-pip install --user filetrack  # install filetrack
-pip install --upgrade filetrack # upgrade filetrack
-pip uninstall filetrack  # uninstall filetrack
-
-# pipx (recommanded)
-pipx install filetrack  # install filetrack through pipx
-pipx upgrade filetrack  # upgrade filetrack through pipx
-pipx uninstall filetrack  # uninstall filetrack through pipx
-```
-
-## Config File
-
-* Config file example: [filetrack.toml]
-
-## Knowledge Base
-
-* Trackings: File hashes to track changes.
-* TrackFile: The output file to hold file trackings.
-* TrackFile Format: Can choose from `TOML` or `JSON`
-* Target File Exts: Files that you wanna track with specific extensions. Leave it empty `[]` or `["*"]` to track all files.
-* Old TrackFile: Autodetect and parse old TrackFile to compared with.
